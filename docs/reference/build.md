# `wick build`

`wick build` compiles the project's `main.go` to a Go binary with version metadata and (optionally) self-updater credentials baked in via `-ldflags`, then wraps it into the platform-native distributable. Replaces the hand-rolled `go build -ldflags …` task that older `wick.yml` templates shipped.

| OS | Default artifact | Add with `--installer` |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | `.exe` with embedded brand icon + version metadata | `.msi` — per-user install to `%LocalAppData%\Programs\<AppName>`, Start Menu shortcut, Add/Remove Programs entry. No UAC at install or update time; the in-app self-updater keeps working in place. Requires `wixl` on PATH; skipped with a warning if missing. |
| macOS | `.app` bundle + `.dmg` disk image (host-darwin only — needs `hdiutil`) | `.dmg` is staged with an `Applications` symlink so Finder shows the standard drag-to-install layout. |
| Linux | `.deb` package (already a proper installer) | unchanged |

## Quick start

```bash
wick build
# bin/<name>-<goos>-<goarch>[.exe]   raw binary
# bin/<name>.app/                    macOS bundle (darwin only)
# bin/<name>-darwin-<arch>.dmg       macOS disk image (darwin host only — needs hdiutil)
# bin/<name>-linux-<arch>.deb        Debian package (linux only)
```

`wick build` reads `name:` and `version:` from `wick.yml`, so a fresh `wick init` project builds without any flags.

## Cross-compile

Pick one — flag, env vars, or both. The flag wins when both are set.

```bash
wick build --target linux/arm64        # shorthand
wick build --goos linux --goarch arm64 # explicit (mirrors env vars)
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 wick build     # env vars (CI flow)
```

Multi-target in one shot — best-effort, skips targets that can't build on the current host (e.g. `darwin/*` when not on macOS):

```bash
wick build --all
# > windows/amd64   ✓ bin/myapp-windows-amd64.exe
# > linux/amd64     ✓ bin/myapp-linux-amd64.deb
# > darwin/amd64    ✗ skipped (darwin needs macOS host)
# Summary: 4/6 succeeded (2 skipped/failed)
```

## Installer mode

`--installer` opts the windows + darwin targets into installer-friendly artifacts on top of the defaults. Off by default so existing pipelines keep producing the same lighter artifacts.

When to enable:
- The app needs a stable install path for autostart entries, file associations, or the in-app self-updater (a portable `.exe` at an arbitrary location breaks all three when the user moves it).
- You want a proper Windows uninstaller listed in Add/Remove Programs.
- You want the macOS `.dmg` to show a drag-to-`Applications` layout instead of just the `.app` icon.

```bash
wick build --installer
wick build --installer --target windows/amd64
```

The Windows `.msi` is built **per-user** and installs to `%LocalAppData%\Programs\<AppName>\<AppName>.exe`. Per-user matters for two reasons:

- **No UAC** at install time, so the wizard runs without admin prompts.
- The install path is **user-writable**, so the in-app self-updater rewrites the `.exe` the same way it does on portable builds — no admin elevation per update.

Building the `.msi` requires `wixl` from msitools on PATH — skipped with a warning when missing, so the `.exe` still ships:

| Host | Install command |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu / Debian | `apt install wixl` |
| Fedora | `dnf install msitools` |
| Arch | `pacman -S msitools` |
| macOS | `brew install msitools` |
| Windows (msys2) | `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-msitools` |

The MSI never adds the app to autostart — autostart stays an opt-in toggle inside the running app, which writes a `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` entry pointing at the installed `.exe` path.

## Embed self-updater credentials

```bash
APP_VERSION=1.2.0 \
RELEASE_GITHUB_PAT=$RELEASE_PAT \
RELEASE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY=acme/myapp-releases \
wick build --target linux/arm64
```

## Flags

| Flag | Env fallback | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--app-name` | `APP_NAME` | Sets `app.BuildAppName`. Used to namespace config / DB / log paths and as the default MCP server name. |
| `--app-version` | `APP_VERSION` | Sets `app.BuildAppVersion`. Shown in the tray title and About menu, advertised by MCP. |
| `--release-github-pat` | `RELEASE_GITHUB_PAT` | Sets `app.GitHubPAT`. Empty = self-updater disabled. |
| `--release-github-repo` | `RELEASE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | Sets `app.GitHubRepo` (releases repo `owner/repo`). Empty = self-updater disabled. Note: not `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` because GitHub Actions auto-injects that to the source repo and silently blocks step-level overrides. |
| `-o`, `--output` | — | Raw binary output path. Default `bin/<app-name>-<goos>-<goarch>[.exe]`. The platform-native distributable (`.dmg` / `.deb` / `.msi`) is always written next to it; this flag only renames the raw binary. |
| `-t`, `--target` | — | Target shorthand `<os>/<arch>` (e.g. `linux/arm64`). Mutually exclusive with `--goos` / `--goarch`. |
| `--goos` | `GOOS` | Target GOOS. Mutually exclusive with `--target`. |
| `--goarch` | `GOARCH` | Target GOARCH. Mutually exclusive with `--target`. |
| `--all` | — | Best-effort build for every supported OS / arch. Skips `darwin/*` on non-darwin hosts. Mutually exclusive with `--target` / `--goos` / `--goarch` / `--output`. |
| `--headless` | — | Adds `-tags headless`. Drops the tray UI; keeps `server`, `worker`, `mcp` subcommands. |
| `--installer` | — | Wrap into installer-friendly artifacts: windows `.msi` (needs `wixl` on PATH) and darwin `.dmg` with Applications symlink. Also bundles the [Command Gate](../guide/command-gate) sidecar (`<app>-gate[.exe]`) alongside the main binary. Off by default. |

## Resolution order

Each value is resolved independently, picking the first non-empty source:

| Value | Order |
|---|---|
| App name | `--app-name` → `$APP_NAME` → `name:` in `wick.yml` → `"app"` |
| App version | `--app-version` → `$APP_VERSION` → `version:` in `wick.yml` → `"dev"` |
| GitHub releases PAT | `--release-github-pat` → `$RELEASE_GITHUB_PAT` |
| GitHub releases repo | `--release-github-repo` → `$RELEASE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY` |

The wick framework version (`BuildWickVersion`) is auto-filled from `debug.ReadBuildInfo()` — no flag.

## End-user install flow

| OS | Default `wick build` | `wick build --installer` |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | Double-click the `.exe` — runs in place. Move the file = move the app. | Double-click the `.msi` → wizard installs to `%LocalAppData%\Programs\<AppName>` (no UAC). Uninstall via Add/Remove Programs. |
| macOS | Open the `.dmg`, drag `<app>.app` into `/Applications`. | Same gesture, but the mounted volume shows `<app>.app` next to an `Applications` shortcut as a visual hint. |
| Linux | `sudo apt install ./<app>-linux-<arch>.deb` (or `dpkg -i`). Installs to `/usr/bin/<app>` with `.desktop` entry + icon. Same flow either way. |
| Termux / Android | Raw `<app>-linux-arm64` binary copied to `$PREFIX/bin/<app>` — no `dpkg`, no GUI deps. Built with `--headless` or pure-Go projects. |

## Install scripts

Every `wick init <name>` drops `install.sh` + `install.ps1` into the project root, pre-baked with the app name and a `REPO="owner/<name>"` placeholder. Commit both to the project's default branch and end-users get a one-liner install:

```bash
# Linux / macOS / Termux — public repo
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<name>/main/install.sh | sh

# Windows — public repo
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<name>/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Private repo — pass a fine-grained PAT (Contents: read) at runtime:

```bash
TOKEN=ghp_xxx sh -c "$(curl -fsSL -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<name>/main/install.sh)"
```

The scripts detect OS + arch from `uname` / `$PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE`, query the GitHub Releases API for the latest tag, and download the right asset:

| Detect | Action |
|---|---|
| `$PREFIX` with `com.termux` | download raw `<app>-linux-<arch>` → `$PREFIX/bin/<app>` + `chmod +x` |
| `uname -s = Darwin` | download `.dmg` → mount via `hdiutil` → copy `.app` to `/Applications` |
| `uname -s = Linux` + `dpkg` present | download `.deb` → `sudo dpkg -i` |
| `uname -s = Linux` + no `dpkg` | download raw binary → `/usr/local/bin/<app>` |
| PowerShell | download `.msi` → `msiexec /i /qn` (silent install) |

After `wick init`, edit the `REPO=` line in both scripts to match the actual GitHub repo owner (the placeholder is `owner/<name>` until you set it). Override the release version with `VERSION=v1.2.3` instead of latest.

::: warning GitHub API rate limit (60 req/hr per IP)
The install scripts call the GitHub Releases API to resolve `latest`. Unauthenticated callers share a 60-request-per-hour quota per IP. On shared egress (CI runners, NAT gateways, Termux on campus Wi-Fi) this limit can be exhausted by other users on the same IP.

When the quota is hit the scripts surface GitHub's own error message and suggest three fixes:

```bash
# Linux / macOS — fix 1: pass a PAT (5 000/hr authenticated limit)
TOKEN=ghp_xxx sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://...install.sh)"

# fix 2: pin a version (skips the API call entirely)
VERSION=v1.2.3 sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://...install.sh)"

# fix 3: wait for the hourly reset (reset time is printed by the script)
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell — same two env vars
$env:TOKEN = 'ghp_xxx'; iwr -useb https://...install.ps1 | iex
$env:VERSION = 'v1.2.3'; iwr -useb https://...install.ps1 | iex
```

The `VERSION=` workaround is the simplest in CI — pin it to the release you want to deploy and the API is never called.
:::

::: tip wick-agent is just the wick repo's own install script
The wick repo ships its own `scripts/install.sh` + `scripts/install.ps1` baked with `APP="wick-agent"` and `REPO="yogasw/wick"`. Running them installs the **wick-agent runtime** (Slack / Telegram / Web agent host) — not the wick CLI used to scaffold projects. The CLI is installed via `go install github.com/yogasw/wick@v0.31.0`.
:::

## ldflags injection

`wick build` calls `go build` with:

```
-X github.com/yogasw/wick/app.BuildAppName=<name>
-X github.com/yogasw/wick/app.BuildAppVersion=<version>
-X github.com/yogasw/wick/app.BuildTime=<RFC3339 UTC timestamp of the build>
-X github.com/yogasw/wick/app.GitHubPATEnc=<base64+xor>  (if non-empty)
-X github.com/yogasw/wick/app.GitHubRepo=<owner/repo>    (if non-empty)
```

`BuildCommit` is populated by `debug.ReadBuildInfo()` — VCS metadata baked in by the Go toolchain when the build happens inside a git checkout. `BuildTime` is injected directly as an `-X` ldflag set to `time.Now().UTC()` (RFC3339) at the moment `wick build` runs. This means the "Built" field is always populated in every build path, including release-pipeline builds that run inside a `wick init` scaffold (a git-less directory) where Go's own `vcs.time` stamping is absent.

**PAT obfuscation:** the PAT is XOR'd with a fixed key and base64-encoded before injection, so plain `strings <binary> | grep ghp_` does not surface the token. This is obfuscation, not encryption — a determined attacker who reads the binary can extract the key and decode. Real defense is scoping the PAT to read-only on the releases repo (a leak only enables downloading already-public release assets).

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

`wick init` copies a single workflow into `template/.github/workflows/release.yml`. Push-to-tag-to-release runs as three sequential jobs in one workflow:

1. **`prepare`** — read `version:` from `wick.yml`. If `v<version>` is not yet a tag on origin (and on the releases repo, when separate), output `created=true` plus the commit SHA. Otherwise output `created=false` and skip downstream jobs. **The tag is not pushed yet.**
2. **`build`** (`needs: prepare`, runs only if `created=true`, `fail-fast: false`) — checkout the SHA, build the matrix targets, upload artifacts. A failed matrix entry does not cancel the others.
3. **`release`** (`needs: [prepare, build]`, runs even if some matrix entries failed) — download artifacts, fail with a clear error if **none** were uploaded, otherwise `gh release create <tag>` against the releases repo and **then** push the tag to the source repo.

**Tag-after-release semantics.** The tag only lands on origin when at least one binary is published. If every build fails, no tag is pushed and a re-run starts from the same SHA. For the same-repo setup, `gh release create --target <sha>` creates the tag atomically with the release; for the separate-releases-repo setup, the tag is pushed via `git push origin <tag>` after `gh release create` succeeds.

**Why one workflow instead of two.** GitHub blocks tag pushes made with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` from triggering other workflows (anti-loop guard). A split design (`auto-tag.yml` → `release.yml`) would need a user PAT to push the tag, otherwise `release.yml` never fires. The single-flow design uses job dependencies (`needs:`) instead of an event-trigger handoff, so it works with `github.token` alone — no `RELEASE_GITHUB_PUBLISH_PAT` required for same-repo setups.

### Build matrix

The shipped workflow runs `wick build --installer`, so each released asset is the platform-native installer:

| OS | Arch | Runner | Released asset |
|---|---|---|---|
| windows | amd64 | `ubuntu-latest` (cross-build) | `<app>-windows-amd64.msi` |
| windows | arm64 | `ubuntu-latest` (cross-build) | `<app>-windows-arm64.msi` |
| darwin | amd64 | `macos-latest` | `<app>-darwin-amd64.dmg` |
| darwin | arm64 | `macos-latest` | `<app>-darwin-arm64.dmg` |
| linux | amd64 | `ubuntu-latest` | `<app>-linux-amd64.deb` |
| linux | arm64 | `ubuntu-latest` | `<app>-linux-arm64.deb` |

Each asset ships with a `.sha256` sibling that the self-updater verifies before extracting the inner binary and swapping in place.

Windows targets cross-compile from `ubuntu-latest` so `wixl` (msitools) can be installed in one `apt install` step — the downstream binary is pure-syscall on windows (no cgo) so the cross-build is byte-identical to a native windows-latest build, and dropping the windows runner shaves ~1 minute off each windows matrix entry.

To ship the lighter portable `.exe` instead of `.msi`, edit the workflow's build step to `wick build` (drop `--installer`) and update the windows asset extension back to `exe`.

### Limiting the build matrix

Set the optional `BUILD_TARGETS` Actions variable (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables) to a comma-separated list of `<os>/<arch>` pairs. Anything not listed is skipped at the start of its runner — no checkout, no build cost. Leave it unset to build everything (the default).

| `BUILD_TARGETS` value | Effect |
|---|---|
| _(unset)_ | Build all six targets. |
| `linux/amd64` | Linux x64 only — useful for Docker-only deployments. |
| `darwin/arm64,linux/amd64` | Mac silicon + Linux x64 — common dev/server combo. |
| `windows/amd64,windows/arm64` | Windows desktop only. |
| `linux/amd64,linux/arm64` | Both Linux arches, skip mac/windows. |

Valid values: `windows/amd64`, `windows/arm64`, `darwin/amd64`, `darwin/arm64`, `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`.

The release job ships whatever artifacts made it through, so this is also a way to drop a flaky target temporarily without editing the workflow.

### Auto-bumping the version

Set the optional `RELEASE_AUTO_VERSION` Actions variable to `true` to make every push to `main` / `master` cut a new release automatically:

1. **`prepare`** runs `wick version next` — reads `version:` from `wick.yml`, bumps the **last numeric segment** by one, writes the new value back, and prints it. If the resulting tag already exists, it bumps again (capped at 50 retries).
2. **`build`** bakes that value into the binary via `APP_VERSION`.
3. **`release`** publishes `vX.Y.Z`, pushes the tag, then re-runs `wick version next` on a fresh checkout (idempotent — same baseline, same bump) and commits the `wick.yml` diff back to the branch with `[skip ci]`.

The bump format follows whatever is already in `wick.yml:version`:

| Current `version:` | Next tag |
|---|---|
| `1` | `v2` |
| `0.1` | `v0.2` |
| `0.6.4` | `v0.6.5` |
| `1.2.3.4` | `v1.2.3.5` |

| `RELEASE_AUTO_VERSION` | Behavior |
|---|---|
| _(unset)_ or `false` | Existing flow — read `version:` as-is, skip if the tag already exists. Bump `wick.yml` manually before each release. |
| `true` | `wick version next` bumps `wick.yml` last segment +1, every push releases, commit-back keeps `wick.yml` in sync with the latest tag. |

#### Why this is safe

- **No infinite loop.** The commit-back step pushes via `github.token`. GitHub explicitly does not re-trigger workflows on commits pushed by `GITHUB_TOKEN` ([anti-loop guard](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow)). The `[skip ci]` marker is belt-and-suspenders.
- **No race.** A workflow-level <code v-pre>concurrency: { group: release-${{ github.ref }}, cancel-in-progress: false }</code> serializes pushes on the same branch, so two pushes can't both try to bump `0.6.4 → 0.6.5`.
- **Atomic enough.** If the release succeeds but the commit-back fails (e.g. branch protection blocks the bot push), the next run reads the still-old `wick.yml`, computes the same tag, and skips with "tag exists." The release isn't lost; the `wick.yml` diff is what's missing — recoverable manually.

#### Manual jump (cut a minor / major release)

Edit `wick.yml:version` to a new base (e.g. `0.7.0`) and push:
- That push releases `v0.7.0`.
- Commit-back bumps to `0.7.1`.
- Auto-bump continues `v0.7.2`, `v0.7.3`, …

#### Branch protection

If `main` / `master` requires PRs or status checks, allow `github-actions[bot]` to bypass — otherwise the commit-back fails. The release itself still publishes; only the `wick.yml` diff is missing.

## PAT setup

The self-updater needs a token that the **shipped binary** can use to read GitHub releases. Treat it as embedded credential, not a build-system secret.

### Two repos (recommended for private apps)

| Repo | Visibility | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `<owner>/<app>` | private (or public) | Source code |
| `<owner>/<app>-releases` | private | Compiled binaries + `.sha256` files |

If the embedded PAT leaks, the attacker can download binaries — they cannot read source.

| Setting | Where | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `vars.RELEASE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | Source repo Actions variables | `<owner>/<app>-releases` |
| `secrets.RELEASE_GITHUB_DOWNLOAD_PAT` | Source repo Actions secrets | Fine-grained PAT scoped to `<app>-releases`, **Contents: read** — gets baked into every binary. |
| `secrets.RELEASE_GITHUB_PUBLISH_PAT` | Source repo Actions secrets | Fine-grained PAT scoped to `<app>-releases`, **Contents: read + write** — only used by the workflow to upload assets. |

### Single repo (source = releases)

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `vars.RELEASE_GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | _(empty — falls back to `github.repository`)_ |
| `secrets.RELEASE_GITHUB_DOWNLOAD_PAT` | Fine-grained PAT scoped to this repo, Contents read — baked into every binary. |
| `secrets.RELEASE_GITHUB_PUBLISH_PAT` | _(not needed — `github.token` has write access to the same repo, and the single-flow design avoids the anti-loop trigger problem.)_ |

The exact step-by-step walkthrough — including links to GitHub's PAT and Actions Secrets pages — lives in the header comments of `template/.github/workflows/release.yml`. Open the workflow file in your generated project; the comments are kept current with the workflow logic.

### Rotating the PAT

GitHub fine-grained PATs cannot be rotated via API. The flow is manual but self-healing:

1. Generate a new PAT with the same scope.
2. Update `secrets.RELEASE_GITHUB_DOWNLOAD_PAT` in the source repo.
3. Bump `version:` in `wick.yml` and push to `main`.
4. `release.yml` tags and builds new binaries with the new PAT embedded.
5. Existing installs auto-update — and the new binaries can keep checking for releases.

When a PAT expires, the tray menu surfaces it as `Update check failed — PAT expired (see logs)`. As long as you ship a new release before the expiry hits every install, no one notices.

## Trigger flow

```
bump version: in wick.yml → push main
    ↓
release.yml job 1 (prepare): tag exists on origin (and releases repo, if separate)?
                                yes → created=false, stop
                                no  → created=true, sha=<HEAD>, no push yet
    ↓
release.yml job 2 (build, fail-fast=false): matrix build N binaries → upload artifacts
                                            (failed entries don't cancel the others)
    ↓
release.yml job 3 (release): any artifacts uploaded?
                                no  → error, no tag pushed, re-run starts clean
                                yes → gh release create + push tag to origin
    ↓
new binary in <app>-releases
    ↓
existing install → self-updater downloads bundle → extracts inner binary → "Restart to apply" appears
```

A manual `git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3` does **not** trigger this workflow — the trigger is `on: push branches`, not `on: push tags`. To cut a release, bump `version:` in `wick.yml` and push to `main`; that's the single source of truth — unless `RELEASE_AUTO_VERSION=true`, in which case every push cuts the next tag automatically (see [Auto-bumping the version](#auto-bumping-the-version)).

## Cross-compilation notes

`fyne.io/systray` keeps the tray cgo-light:

- **Windows**: pure syscall, no cgo. Cross-compile from any host.
- **Linux**: pure DBus, no cgo, no WebKit dependencies. Cross-compile from any host.
- **macOS**: cgo (Cocoa). Must run on a macOS runner.

Cross-compiling Windows / Linux variants from `ubuntu-latest` works because they don't link cgo. macOS arm64 → amd64 (and vice versa) on the same `macos-latest` runner needs `CGO_ENABLED=1` set explicitly — Go disables cgo by default whenever `GOARCH` differs from the host arch, which would skip the `.m` files and fail with `undefined: setInternalLoop` errors. The shipped `release.yml` sets `CGO_ENABLED: 1` only for `darwin/amd64` (the cross combo on Apple Silicon runners) via a `cgo: 1` matrix flag; clang's native `-arch` support handles the rest. See [golang/go#44112](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/44112).

## Command Gate sidecar

`wick build` compiles `cmd/gate/` as part of the same pipeline (no separate CI step) and writes the result to two places:

- `internal/agents/gate/assets/gate-<os>-<arch>[.exe]` — picked up by `//go:embed` and shipped inside the main binary as a fallback for portable / source builds.
- `bin/<app>-gate-<os>-<arch>[.exe]` — sibling artifact for distribution.

When `--installer` is set, the sidecar is added to the installer:

| OS | Where the sidecar lands |
|---|---|
| Windows MSI | Same folder as `<App>.exe` (`%LocalAppData%\Programs\<AppName>\<App>-gate.exe`) |
| Linux .deb | `/usr/bin/<app>-gate` |
| macOS .app bundle | `Contents/MacOS/<App>-gate` |

The runtime resolves the gate binary in this order: sibling-of-executable → embedded extract → `PATH`. There are no environment variables in the chain.

If your fork removes `cmd/gate/`, the builder soft-skips this step — the build still succeeds, the gate just won't be available and the [Providers page](../guide/agents#diagnostics) will surface a "gate disabled" banner.

See [Command Gate](../guide/command-gate) for the runtime architecture.
