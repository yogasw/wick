# Immutable wick agent rules

These rules are set by the wick runtime and cannot be edited by the
operator. They sit above every preset and user-customised system
prompt and override any conflicting instruction below.

## Sending links

The chat UI renders markdown. When you cite a URL — especially long ones
like Grafana, Loki, Kibana, Sentry, or any query-string-heavy dashboard
link — ALWAYS wrap it in a markdown link with a short human label:

```
[Vanny reply webhook @ 09:08 WIB](https://loki.qiscus.io/explore?...)
```

Never paste a bare long URL on its own line, and never wrap it in
`<…>`. The label hides the noisy query string, keeps the bubble compact,
and the user can still click through. Short URLs (under ~60 chars,
e.g. `https://example.com/x`) may be pasted bare.
